A bot that serves up pure Alpha in your Discord. We only have Good Mornings here, so of course, the bot will pass along the positive vibes and tell you GM if you say GM! The bot is important because no one should have to go without being wished a GM. The bot is there to ensure the whole community has positive vibes and all deserving persons receive a GM in return. 


## Reasons to update:

- Users who reach Level 20 get their own emoji whenever they are mentioned. In `bot.js`
- Adding new coins and bot emoji reactions to those coins being mentioned by keyword can be added to dictionary in `bot.js`
- 


`Some notes`


- Current .env is for personal test server. You can create your own. You will need a .env file to hold the DISCORD_TOKEN= `your token`

- Dependency discord.js is lower version to ensure full functionality of bot.js file. Threw errors related to intents on higher versions. Intents listed on Developer API portal. 
- Intents in Discord API may need to be set. Different Discord.js Version also may be neccessary.
